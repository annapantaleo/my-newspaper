						</figure>
                        <p>Michael Gary Scott was born March 15, 1965, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He came from a relatively difficult childhood of loneliness. Michael had some trouble with his early education, shown in "Dunder Mifflin Infinity" as Michael tells the camera crew he was held back from second-grade. In "Diversity Day", Michael claims to be of English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. He also claims to be "two-fifteenths" Native American. He has mentioned a stepfather, Jeff, whom he despises.
                        <p>In "Nepotism", it is revealed that Michael had a half-sister, from whom he was estranged for 15 years. As a consequence of their reunion, Michael hires his nephew Luke as an intern for the office, but eventually confronts the incompetent and rude Luke and ends up spanking him in front of the office, leading Luke to burst into tears and quit.</p>
                        <p>Michael tends to overestimate his importance to his employees, but despite constantly offending some of them, he has a close bond with them. Most of the employees have been the focus of Michael's jokes at one point or another, usually in reference to their race, sex, size, attractiveness, or sexual orientation. Examples of Michael's difficult relationship with his staff include getting slapped by Kelly for being racist, hitting Meredith with his car, getting kicked out of Phyllis and Bob's wedding, and outing Oscar to the entire office without his permission. They are, however, generally sympathetic to his shortcomings and, while regularly losing patience when he interrupts their workflow, often try to assist him with his personal problems.</p>

						</figure>
                        Dwight Schrute is a competent salesman at the Dunder Mifflin, Scranton branch. Dwight formally held the title of "Assistant to the Regional Manager", but constantly refers to himself as "Assistant Regional Manager", attempting to elevate himself to second-in-command to branch Manager, Michael Scott.</p>
                        <p>Dwight is a former volunteer sheriff deputy but has to stepdown after breaking his pledge to help his boss, Michael, illegally pass a drug test by giving him his urine in the episode "Drug Testing." He is also a notary public; this creates difficulties when Angela desires to send him a notarized letter regarding their break-up. He resides on his family's beet farm, alongside his cousin, Mose. Dwight has affinities for paintball, Battlestar Galactica, ping pong, survivalism, Goju Ryu karate and weapons.</p>
                        <p>Little is known about Dwight's parents, except that his father used to take him hunting, cheated in games, made him and his siblings biscuits for breakfast every morning, and that he battled obesity, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.</p>

								<figcaption class="figcaption">Toby Flanderson</figcaption>
						</figure>
                        <p>Toby is divorced and has a daughter, Sasha. At work, Toby is hated by Michael because as HR representative, he is always stifling Michael's inappropriate fun. He also continually addresses Michael like an adult, instead of pandering to his antics. When Andy is manager, he begins developing a similar hatred for Toby after he shuts down his fraudulent ideas such as making up a cause to get Nellie fired. Additionally, when Jim is acting manager in Survivor Man, he's annoyed by a simple request from Toby, describing him as "a little bit much" despite having been on good terms with him in other episodes.</p>
                        <p>Toby possesses a master's degree in social work from Temple University as seen in Counseling. The frame is crooked in the shot. In Season 4, Episode 2, a diploma is visible in Toby's cubicle that reads "California Coastal College, BSc in Psychology, Toby Flenderson", as well as a bumper sticker from Penn State University.</p>
                        <p>Toby Flenderson is the Scranton Stangler. This is by far one of the most popular fan theories not only concerning the Strangler, but the show in general. While the Strangler struck at many random times, they seemed to have started after Jim started dating Pam, who Toby had a crush on. As Pam and Jim's life improves, he realizes how terrible his life is. The type of car seen during the chase was also seen in the Dunder Mifflin parking lot in the cold open of "Gossip", and Toby was the only person who did not watch the chase on television, even though everyone was crowded around Toby's desk. Also, the call that Kelly hangs up was likely to be personal, due to Erin not being at reception to forward the call. It is possible that he was going to confess to the staff, as the only person likely to know Toby's specific phone number at work would be Toby himself.</p>

						</figure>
                        <p>Ryan Howard is an American salesman, former receptionist, and convicted fraudster who works at Dunder Mifflin. He was a temporary employee until he is promoted as Vice President of Sales. However, David Wallace demotes him when the Michael Scott Paper Company is acquired by Dunder Mifflin. He also worked at the Michael Scott Paper Company until the acquisition. Ryan was convicted of fraud for misleading the shareholders of Dunder Mifflin, and was arrested. However, he was released and required to do community service.</p>
                        <p>Little is known about Ryan Howard's early life, but it is revealed in a deleted scene from "Diversity Day" that he grew up in Scranton and attended Penn State University. In the webisode "The Story of Subtle Sexuality", Ryan mentions that his parents live in separate houses. At the beginning of the series, Ryan Howard is a temporary employee at the Scranton branch of the fictitious paper distributor Dunder Mifflin who joined the staff in the first episode, earning him the nickname "The Temp".</p>
                        <p>Ryan was a member of a fraternity in college and holds an MBA from the University of Scranton's Kania School of Management, which he earned during the second and third seasons. His dream is to one day own his own business. Throughout the series, Ryan changes his persona every year beginning with the third season. When offered a job for Corporate in the season 3 finale, Ryan relocates to New York City and adopts a nouveau riche persona: becoming extroverted, growing a beard, wearing nice suits, and getting $200 haircuts. But he subsequently ends up partying hard and getting addicted to drugs and alcohol. His downfall culminates in misleading Dunder-Mifflin's shareholders via his website's sales numbers, effectively committing fraud as Oscar Martinez later claims.</p>

								<figcaption class="figcaption">Kelly Kapoor</figcaption>
						</figure>
                        <p>Kelly is first featured in the episode "Diversity Day", where Michael conducts a diversity training seminar. Michael creates a game where everyone in the room has to put a card with a specific race on their forehead (with the race being unknown to themselves), and then must treat everyone as if they were the race on their card. Frustrated that no one is playing properly, Michael attempts to demonstrate how to play by speaking to Kelly, who has just entered the room, in a stereotypical Indian accent. Offended, Kelly angrily slaps Michael and leaves the conference room.</p>
                        <p>In the second season, Kelly gets involved in a wildly uneven relationship with Ryan Howard, the office temp. Following their first date, Ryan expresses his regret, as their first date occurred the day before Valentine's Day. In the episode "Take Your Daughter To Work Day", Kelly shows a manipulative side upon witnessing Stanley's teenage daughter, Melissa, shadowing Ryan. Jealous, Kelly tells Stanley that Ryan had flirted with Melissa, after which Stanley berates Ryan. In the season finale "Casino Night", Ryan wearily admits to Jim that he is still dating Kelly.</p>
                        <p>Kelly and Ryan's relationship continues throughout the third season, though at the Hindu Diwali festival, Kelly's parents criticize her choice in Ryan for not making enough money and not being committed to marriage and family; they suggest that she go for a particular, more successful Indian man. In "Business School", Michael moves Ryan's desk next to Kelly's. Kelly is excited by the move, though she and Ryan bicker and passionately make up frequently. In "Product Recall", Kelly is seen in a rare professional capacity, training Oscar, Angela, and Kevin for taking customer service phone calls after an obscene watermark is printed on Dunder Mifflin paper, prompting too many complaint calls for Kelly alone to answer.</p>
