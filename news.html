            The Test Valley Borough Council (TVBC) bin was spotted by a journalist close to the Polish border. Philip Crowther, who is reporting on the war in Ukraine for the AP news agency, posted a video of it on Twitter. He saw the out-of-place black waste bin last Friday, as he was leaving Lviv, where he had been working for two weeks, the Hampshire Chronicle reported. It said the bin was on the side of the road in Hlynystsi, just before the crossing into Poland and was being used by the border guard station. Waste and recycling portfolio holder at TVBC, Councillor Nick Adams-King, said: "It's good to see our bins are well travelled and to hear that it's still of use for the border guard station between Ukraine and Poland. "Residents have been able to buy our bins for a number of years now, and therefore in theory they can end up anywhere, even eastern Europe. "While we're not sure exactly how this one made its way there, it's always interesting to see where they end up - even if collection does prove to be a bit of a challenge. "I'm afraid I can't promise we will be able to deliver a new blue bin and food caddy to accompany it when we roll the new recycling system out."</p></div>

            <p>“Not your everyday arrest! Our team showed no fear and got the job done! You never know what you’ll encounter as an officer!” wrote the police department on Facebook. Charleston Police say during mating season, daily alligator-related calls are not uncommon. Just the day before this incident, another alligator led investigators on a slow speed chase down a residential street.</p>

The spaceham reached a maximum altitude of 14 miles (23km) - and is in good health after being safely recovered from the sea off Japan's Miyako Island. According to Iwatani Giken, the company behind the daring experiment, the hamster was placed in an airtight cabin 60cm high and 50cm in diameter, with the same atmospheric pressure and temperature as the ground. </p>

                <p> One photograph showed the rodent looking wistfully out the window while seven miles (12km) above the Earth. The balloon was launched from Miyakojima, a city in Okinawa Prefecture, and climbed at an average of 6.3 metres per second. A camera installed inside the cabin showed the animal snoozing comfortably during the gradual ascent. Iwatani Giken is hoping to bring manned space travel to the masses, and the experiment was designed to give would-be consumers’ confidence. Further test flights to an altitude of 15 miles (25km) are planned - and at this height, people would be able to see the curvature of the Earth. Running in a wheel may seem a little underwhelming for the hamster now that it's got a taste for heights. </p>

            <p>A loving Labrador has taken on the responsibility of 15 orphaned ducklings, after their mother suddenly vanished. But Fred the 15-year-old Lab is no stranger to being a foster father - in 2018, he made headlines when he raised nine abandoned ducklings in a similar situation. Years later, the old dog has become the proud dad to a new brood, and he couldn't be happier about it. </p><p> A series of pictures show the tiny ducklings huddling between Fred's front legs and resting proudly on his back, as they lay together in the sun. The bright yellow balls of fluff appear to be happy and comfortable, tucked up closely to their new parent.</p>

            <p> "Over the 15 years of owning him, Fred has spent a lot of time at the Castle with the animals and it has become second nature to him being amongst the various rescued animals," he explained. Fred has a very calm and gentle nature and the baby ducks have taken to him instantly. They are expected to remain with Fred at the castle until they're old enough to survive on their own.</p>

David Emerson Proudfoot was arrested and is facing third-degree grand theft charges and obstruction by false information after he allegedly donned a Disney name tag and attempted to steal a “Star Wars” R2-D2 statue worth up to $10,000, Law & Crime reported.</p>

                        <p> A “confused” Proudfoot was allegedly spotted pushing a cart while leaving the Swan and Dolphin Hotel, according to the news outlet. An affidavit said he identified himself with a name of someone who didn’t work for Walt Disney World and eventually said he was moving the statue and a game machine “on the property.”</p>
                        <p> The man said he applied for a Disney World security job, the affidavit said, and wanted to move the items to point out security lapses in hopes of getting a better paying position. He allegedly told police it wasn’t his goal to take the items from Disney World, although a search warrant at his home “revealed thousands of dollars worth of items” from the theme park, Law & Crime reported. </p>
