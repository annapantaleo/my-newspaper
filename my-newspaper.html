The spaceham reached a maximum altitude of 14 miles (23km) - and is in good health after being safely recovered from the sea off Japan's Miyako Island. According to Iwatani Giken, the company behind the daring experiment, the hamster was placed in an airtight cabin 60cm high and 50cm in diameter, with the same atmospheric pressure and temperature as the ground. </p>

            <p>A loving Labrador has taken on the responsibility of 15 orphaned ducklings, after their mother suddenly vanished. But Fred the 15-year-old Lab is no stranger to being a foster father - in 2018, he made headlines when he raised nine abandoned ducklings in a similar situation. Years later, the old dog has become the proud dad to a new brood, and he couldn't be happier about it. </p><p> A series of pictures show the tiny ducklings huddling between Fred's front legs and resting proudly on his back, as they lay together in the sun. The bright yellow balls of fluff appear to be happy and comfortable, tucked up closely to their new parent.</p>
